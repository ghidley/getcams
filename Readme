Design Goals
Replicates archive*'s getcamsXXXanimations + c1's updatedanimations functionality initially (populating c1:/Data/archive, while disabling archive* scp's and ssh's to c1)
Could at some point also populate wfe camera web site (displacing archive*)
Provide alternate timing mechanism not dependent on cron ... drive via boot startup
 
Design Phases
DONE: Use prefetched image for initial POC for mobo cam ... embed args in program
DONE: Add lookup of security info from protected file 
DONE: Convert to use boot driven run_cameras - getcams-xxx.pl invocation
DONE: When private network is accessible, use in program fetch of cam image
Test timing and functionality ...
When available, use fetch proxie
